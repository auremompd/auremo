= Introduction =

Auremo is a simple to use, graphical standalone client for Music Player Daemon that runs on Windows .NET 4.0. As of version 0.1.0 it supports the most essential MPD features: playlist creation using a drag & drop interface and simple playback control.

Auremo was first written to fulfill the author's own needs for a straightforward MPD client for Windows. If other people find it useful, more features can be easily added in later versions. As is, Auremo should be stable enough for general use and have enough features for real use.

The UpcomingFeatures page lists changes planned for the next release.
