#summary Welcome to Auremo

= Auremo =

Auremo is a simple graphical standalone client for Music Player Daemon. It runs on Windows Vista, 7 and 8.

== Design ==

Auremo's design philosophy is to provide a straightforward MPD client that has enough features to satisfy most users, yet is very easy to install and run. It is designed mainly for desktop and laptop computers that have a pointing device suitable for drag and drop.

To run the software you need a MPD server running on either the local computer or a remote one. Nothing else is required -- Auremo is a single executable and only depends on things that come preinstalled on any modern Windows computer.

Auremo is written from scratch in C#. The user interface is implemented in WPF/XAML. The project can be compiled with e.g. Visual C# 2010 Express, which is available free of charge.

== Project status ==

Auremo's newest version (0.3.0) was released on the 3rd of September, 2012 (ChangeLog). See the CurrentFeatures page for a brief explanation of what Auremo can currently do.

Version 0.4 is in the early stages of planning. The UpcomingFeatures page lists the planned additions for that release. There is also a RoadMap of the long-term plans for Auremo.

== Feedback ==

User feedback is encouraged! If you like Auremo, have bugs to report or would like to suggest new features, or you just like conversation, please e-mail the author.

Help is particularly welcome. The GUI needs attention from an expert artist (preferably one with WPF/XAML skills). Or, if you are good at drawing, there are textures that need creating.
