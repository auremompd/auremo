#summary Features planned for the next release

= Partial to-do list for version 0.3.0 =

== Committed features ==

These features are already available in SVN in the 0.2-dev branch. All or some of them may also be available as a preview release in the downloads section.

  * Add an artist/album/song tree view of the music collection.

== Features to add ==

These features will be added before the release.

  * Add support for saving and loading playlists.
  * Add more music collection browsing modes (genre/album/song tree, genre/album/song as lists).
  * Add a page for MPD server administration. At least rescanning the music collection (and reloading it in the client) needs to be supported. Support password-protected servers.
  * An effort to vastly improve Auremo's visual style is underway. It may or may not the included in 0.3.0. In either case the style will be changed in a single revision instead of gradually. Help is welcome.
