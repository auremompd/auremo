#summary Features planned for the next release

= Partial to-do list for version 0.2.0 =

== Committed features ==

These features are already available in SVN in the 0.2-dev branch. All or some of them may also be available as a preview release in the downloads section.

  * Add a tooltip on the mouse cursor when dragging entries describing the contents of the drag.
  * Improve the color scheme, especially the library and playlist headers. this involves getting rid of the !ListView control in favor of the heavier !DataGrid control.

== Features to add ==

These features will be added before the release.

  * Add another way of choosing item to add to the playlist. The second way will be a directory tree, implemented as a !TreeView. Dragging directories and files will be supported, as well as selecting multiple things at once. This will take a lot of effort as WPF's !TreeView does not support multiselect in any way.
  * See if it would be possible to improve the installer at least a little bit (install under Program Files at the very least). NSIS promising for implementing this. A raw executable file will still be available as before.
