#summary Features planned for the next release

= Partial to-do list for version 0.2.0 =

== Committed features ==

These features are already available in SVN in the 0.2-dev branch. All or some of them may also be available as a preview release in the downloads section.

  * Add a tooltip on the mouse cursor when dragging entries describing the contents of the drag.
  * Improve the color scheme, especially the library and playlist headers. this involves getting rid of the !ListView control in favor of the heavier !DataGrid control.

== Features to add ==

These features will be added before the release.

  * Add a directory tree view of the music database, allow drag/drop to the playlist. Make this an alternative to the current artist/album/song list views, probably by adding a tab control to contain the alternatives.
  * See if it would be possible to improve the installer at least a little bit (install under Program Files at the very least). NSIS promising for implementing this.
