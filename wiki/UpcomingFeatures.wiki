#summary Features planned for the next release

= Partial to-do list for version 0.2.0 =

== Committed features ==

These features are already available in SVN in the 0.2-dev branch. All or some of them may also be available as a preview release in the downloads section.

  * Add a tooltip on the mouse cursor when dragging entries describing the contents of the drag.
  * Improve the color scheme, especially the library and playlist headers. this involves getting rid of the !ListView control in favor of the heavier !DataGrid control.
  * Add another way of choosing item to add to the playlist. The second way is a directory tree, implemented as a !TreeView. Multi-selection with a mouse and drag&drop to the playlist are supported.
  * Add a proper installer. It is still relatively simple, but actually installs under Program Files like it's supposed to.

== Features to add ==

These issues will be addressed before the release.

  * Fix unselection with ctrl+mouse in data grids.
  * Add keyboard support in tree views.
  * Enable queuing music using the keyboard.
  * Test and debug some more.
