#summary Planned future features

= Introduction =

This is a list of features that are planned for future releases but are not yet in any development branch. Suggestions are welcome! If there is something you want added to the list, please [mailto:auremompd@gmail.com e-mail] the author.

=== Important features ===

  * Improve the look & feel. The color scheme is off and practically all of the controls need customization. The goal is to make Auremo very aesthetic. Help from an expert artist would help here.
  * Make browsing and copying saved playlists more versatile. 

=== Nice to have features ===

  * Add more ways to browse the music collection.
  * Add optional criteria for sorting albums. For example, the user should be able to choose alphabetical, chronological or filesystem ordering.
  * Create a cool custom control for the volume knob. A slider is typical but not very pretty, plus it takes a lot of space.
  * Add settings for hiding individual music collection tabs and, if feasible, disabling the data model behind them entirely. This would make the GUI quicker and less cluttered.
  * Album art, supposing that it can be incorporated in the GUI in a meaningful way. This should probably be an opt-in feature because it can be heavy and not useful for all users.
  * Lyrics. This must definitely be an opt-in feature.
