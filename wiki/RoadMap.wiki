#summary Planned future features

= Introduction =

This is a list of features that are planned for future releases but not the current development branch. Suggestions are welcome! If there is something you want added to the list, please [mailto:auremompd@gmail.com e-mail] the author.

=== Important features ===
  * Add support for saving and loading playlists. A clear playlist button would also be useful.
  * Add more ways to browse the music collection. At least:
      * Artist/album/song as a tree view.
      * Genre/album/song as a tree view.
      * Genre/album/song as a three list hierarchy.
  * Add support for password protected MPD servers.
  * Improve the look & feel. The color scheme is off and practically all of the controls need customization. The goal is to Auremo very aesthetic.

=== Nice to have features ===
  * Create a cool custom control for the volume knob. A slider is typical but not very pretty, plus it takes a lot of space.
  * Add settings for hiding individual music collection tabs and, if possible, disabling the data model behind them entirely. This would make the GUI quicker and less cluttered.
  * Album art, supposing that it can be incorporated in the GUI in a meaningful way. This should probably be an opt-in feature because it can be heavy and not useful for all users.
  * Lyrics. This must definitely be an opt-in feature.
