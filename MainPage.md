# Auremo #

Auremo is a simple graphical standalone client for Music Player Daemon. It runs on Windows Vista, 7 and 8.

## Design ##

Auremo's design philosophy is to provide a straightforward MPD client that has enough features to satisfy most users, yet is very easy to install and run. It is designed mainly for desktop and laptop computers that have a pointing device suitable for drag and drop.

To run the software you need a MPD server running on either the local computer or a remote one. Nothing else is required -- Auremo is a single executable and only depends on things that come preinstalled on any modern Windows computer.

Auremo is written from scratch in C#. The user interface is implemented in WPF/XAML. The project can be compiled with e.g. Visual C# 2012 Express, which is available free of charge.

## Project status ##

Auremo's latest stable version (0.6.1) was released on the 22nd of September, 2013 (ChangeLog). See the CurrentFeatures page for a brief explanation of what Auremo can currently do.

Development continues in the 0.7 line. The UpcomingFeatures page tracks changes made to the development branch, as well as plans for the next release.

There is also a RoadMap of the long-term plans for Auremo.
