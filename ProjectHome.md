**Auremo to move to a new site**

19th March 2015

A few day ago Google has [announced](http://google-opensource.blogspot.fi/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) that Google Code will be shut down later this year. Auremo will continue, but now needs to find a new hosting site. There are various options being evaluated at the moment and the new site should be available soon. During the switch Auremo will also move from its current Subversion repository to a Git one.

**Back from hiatus, Auremo 0.7.0 released**

14th September 2014

After almost a full year after the previous release, Auremo 0.7.0 is now available at the download site. Prominent new features include Mopidy support, a new search feature and a completely reworked networking subsystem. The ChangeLog page details the rest. As usual, please report all bugs, preferably via e-mail (but the issue tracker page is OK as well).

The old download page will now be taken down as uploading the latest releases there is no longer impossible. Please follow the link above to get to the new download site.

**New download site, pre-releases of 0.7.x**

26th September 2013

There is now a new official [download site](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bzt-AN6S9mTEa2JHSUl6SXRpOW8&usp=sharing) for Auremo at Google Drive. The old downloads page will stay until the end of 2013, but at that point new downloads will only appear on the new site and the old page will be phased out.

The change is due to a policy change by Google code as detailed [here](http://google-opensource.blogspot.fi/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html).

The new download site features a pre-releases folder from which you can find the current Mopidy-aware development build of the upcoming 0.7.0 version. If you run the Mopidy server, give it a try and report any bugs via e-mail.

**Auremo 0.6.1 released**

22nd September 2013

So, let's try this again. Auremo 0.6.1 is now available on the downloads page. It fixes a pair of bugs in 0.6.0. If you find more, please let me know.

**Auremo 0.6.0 released**

22nd September 2013

Auremo 0.6.0 is now available on the downloads page. The wiki will be updated momentarily.

This release adds usability improvements, new ways to adjust the GUI to your liking, an improved playlists view and more. Please see the ChangeLog page for details.

**Update:** Some bugs appear to have crept into this build. Expect a 0.6.1 in a few days. If you want this update anyway, please report any bugs you find via e-mail.

**Auremo 0.5.1 released**

27th June 2013

Auremo 0.5.1 is now available on the downloads page. This is a bug fix revision and doesn't add new features.

**Auremo 0.5.0 released**

15th June 2013

Auremo 0.5.0 is now available on the downloads page and the ChangeLog has been updated. This version adds a search tab, support for HTTP streams, audio output selection and many GUI enhancements. Thanks to everyone who helped by testing the prerelease versions.
